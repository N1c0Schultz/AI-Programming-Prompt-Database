# Contributing to Code Prompt Database

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Code Prompt Database! This project thrives on community contributions and we welcome all forms of participation.

## ü§ù How to Contribute

### Adding New Prompts

1. **Fork the repository** and create a new branch for your contribution
2. **Choose the appropriate step file** based on the development workflow phase
3. **Follow the existing format**:
   - Add a descriptive title
   - Include a use-case description
   - Provide the copy-pastable prompt
   - Ensure the prompt follows best-practice prompt engineering

### Improving Existing Prompts

1. **Test the prompt** thoroughly before suggesting changes
2. **Provide clear reasoning** for the improvement in your pull request
3. **Maintain compatibility** with common AI IDEs and assistants

### Format Guidelines

Each prompt should follow this structure:

```markdown
#### Prompt Title
**Use Case**: Brief description of when and how to use this prompt

**Copy-Pastable Prompt**:
```
[Your prompt content here]
```
```

### Quality Standards

- **Clarity**: Prompts should be clear and unambiguous
- **Specificity**: Include relevant context and constraints
- **Tested**: Verify prompts work with popular AI assistants
- **Concise**: Remove unnecessary words while maintaining effectiveness

## üìù Submission Process

1. **Create an Issue** (optional but recommended for major additions)
2. **Fork and Branch**: Create a feature branch from main
3. **Make Changes**: Add or modify prompts following our guidelines
4. **Test Thoroughly**: Verify prompts work as expected
5. **Submit Pull Request**: Include a clear description of changes

## üéØ What We're Looking For

- **New workflow steps** or use cases not currently covered
- **Language-specific prompts** for popular programming languages
- **Framework-specific prompts** for common frameworks
- **Improved clarity** or effectiveness of existing prompts
- **Documentation improvements**
- **Bug fixes** in existing prompts

## üö´ What We Won't Accept

- Prompts that encourage harmful or unethical practices
- Overly complex prompts that could be simplified
- Duplicate prompts without clear improvement
- Prompts without proper testing or validation

## üí° Prompt Engineering Best Practices

When creating prompts, consider:

- **Role definition**: Clearly define the AI's role
- **Context setting**: Provide necessary background information
- **Clear instructions**: Use imperative language
- **Output format**: Specify desired response format
- **Constraints**: Include relevant limitations or requirements

## üîç Review Process

1. **Initial Review**: Maintainers review for basic guidelines compliance
2. **Testing**: Prompts are tested with common AI assistants
3. **Community Feedback**: Open for community input (if significant)
4. **Final Approval**: Maintainers approve and merge

## üìû Getting Help
